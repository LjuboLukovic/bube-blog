Hi there!

I am an experienced software engineer who primarily writes about frontend technologies, along with leadership and business practices.
While I specialize in frontend development, Iâ€™ve also dabbled in backend and native mobile, making me a bit of a tech all-rounder.

But thereâ€™s more to me than just code. Iâ€™m passionate about personal growth, exploring what it means to become the best version of yourself. When Iâ€™m not geeking out over Bitcoinâ€™s potential to reshape the world, youâ€™ll find me cheering for Arsenal FC ðŸ˜€ .

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I connect the dots between all these passions. Thanks for stopping byâ€”letâ€™s break some frameworks together!
